This repository contains a QuTiP-based implementation of a variational algorithm for finding the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a dissipative quantum system under collective dephasing. The approach is based on the McLachlan variational principle, which minimizes the trace norm $\mathrm{Tr}|\dot{\rho}|$ to approximate the stationary solution of the Lindblad master equation.
